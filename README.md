A simple Rock / Paper / Scissors in Python

3 functions: 1 for the player's choice, 1 for the computer, 1 to compare and display the results

It's "just" a Rock-Paper-Scissors, didn't add the lizard and the spock

To execute with Python 3, type python3 rockpaper1.py

It's not producing the results I wanted. There is a problem with the loop (counter and turns). Also doesn't always compare the options.
